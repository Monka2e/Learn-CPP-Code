/*
In the chapter 4 comprehensive quiz, we wrote a program to simulate a ball falling off of a tower.
Because we didnâ€™t have loops yet, the ball could only fall for 5 seconds.

Take the program below and modify it so that the ball falls for as many seconds as needed until it reaches the ground.

    // If so, set the height to ground-level
    if (heightNow < 0.0)
        return 0.0;
    else
        return heightNow;
